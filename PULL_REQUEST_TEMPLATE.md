#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Teddy and Castr paired together. It took about an hour**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started by adding the Handlebars library
  2. Next, we started adding templates for blog posts in script tag associated with our template
  3. We worked .toHtml to compile and render the template for each of an article (ex: return templateRender(this))
